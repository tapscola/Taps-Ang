A java application program uses GUI components with interface that should provide the following functionalities:

The user is able to select a colour of an object outline.

The user is able to select a colour to be filled into an object.

The user is able to select an object to draw. The object should be drawn in a continuous motion of the mouse; dragging will set the size of the shape. For instance, when the user presses a button, the program captures the first coordinate, and on the release of mouse, the shape is drawn on the interface . While the user is moving mouse when the button is already down, the interface should show the updated shape.
